SysTick Registers
SysTick Control and Status at address: 0xE000E010
STCTRL(0x010)	:	D0->Enable (enables or disables the counter).
				:	D1->INTEN for interrupt.
				:	D2->CLK_SRC	Precision internal clock (PIOSC) divided by 4.
				:	D16->COUNT (When SysTick counts down to zero it turns to '1').

SysTick Reload Value: 0xE000E014
STRELOAD(0x014)	: used to set the start value of SysTick counter down, (only the lower 24 bits are used).
				  If you needs 1000 clocks of interval, use value N-1,(999) and its max value 0xFFFFFF.
				  
				
Generating delays using TI timers
RCGCTIMER (0x604)	:	R0	Timer 0	
					:	R1	Timer 1
					:	R2	Timer 2
					:	R3	Timer 3
					:	R4	Timer 4
					:	R5	Timer 5

GPTMTnV (GPTM Timer Value) (GPTMTAV and GPTMTBV)	16bit->work as 2 separate timers.
													32bit->Work as cascaded one timer.
													
GPTM Timer n Match Register (GPTMTnMATCHR)
Timer value (GPTMTnV) compared with the Match Register (GPTMTnMATCHR), if matches (TAMRIS) flag goes up.

GPTMRIS(0x01C)	:	D4	TAMRIS
				:	D11	TBMRIS

GPTMCTL(0x00C)	: During initialization of timer bit D0 (TAEN) for timerA or
										   D8 (TBEN) for timerB register must be disabled.


GPTM Configuration Register(0x000)
	To Configure Timer as 16-bit or 32-bit or RTC counter.
	if 16-bit, so we will have 2 separate registers TimerA and TimerB.
	else if 32-bit, the two timers will be cascaded.
				:	D4	(TACDIR) The direction Count.	1: Down counter | 0: Up counter.


GPTMTnILR GPTM Timer n Interval Load.
	If the timer counts down (TACDIR bit is 0), the timer begin counting from Interval Load value
	until it reaches zero. Then, the timer counter is loaded with the Interval Load and TnTORIS in GPTMRIS
	go to high.









1) enable the clock to Timer0 block.
2) disable timer while the configuration is being modified.
3) select 16-bit mode.
4) select one-shot mode and down -counter mode.
//Timer0_GPTMTAMR |= (1 << 1);       //Periodic Mode.
//Timer0_GPTMTAMR |= (3 << 0);       //Capture Mode.
5) set interval load register value.
7) enable timer.
8) wait for timeout flag to set (at RIS bit 0).
